    There's so much evidence that getting outside is good for you. You might
    already have heard how it can improve your mental health and wellbeing, but
    it can also improve your creativity, and your attention span. It can even
    make you a nicer person. This session could benefit anyone who is spending
    most of their day in front of a screen.
