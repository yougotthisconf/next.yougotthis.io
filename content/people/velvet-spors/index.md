Velvet Spors is a communication designer, creative technologist, and postdoctoral researcher, based in the Gamification Group at Tampere University in Tampere, Finland. Velvet is currently researching how technology can support meaningful moments and connections with natureâ€”particularly by drawing inspiration from how people use games as self-care tools.
Velvet undertook their PhD at the Mixed Reality Lab, University of Nottingham (UK), where they investigated how games can support people in making sense of their (mental) health in holistic, person-centred ways, as caring systems. Their work is motivated by the belief that a different world is not only possible, but certain.
