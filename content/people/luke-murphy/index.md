Luke currently leads the Design Advocacy team at zeroheight. Before zeroheight, Luke has worked in product design and advocacy teams at Memrise, Mr & Mrs Smith and Microsoft. He hosts the DesignOps Island Discs and Rhythm & Brews podcasts, and co-organises DesignOps Assembly London, Design Club London and WDC conference in Bristol. When heâ€™s not shouting about design systems and designops, he is busy raising his 9 year old son, shouting in a punk band, running an Etsy shop, or telling the world why Josie and the Pussycats is a criminally underrated film.
