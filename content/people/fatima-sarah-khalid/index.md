Fatima is a Developer Evangelist at GitLab and the voice of the community. She loves coding challenges and storytelling. Before GitLab, she has been a backend developer and Drupal core contributor, and mentoring lead. In 2018, she received the Women in Communications & Technology (WCT) Rising Star leadership award for her efforts in teaching and advocacy. When she's not playing board games, beating escape rooms, or playing co-op adventures with friends, you can find Fatima reading by the ocean.
