Eileen Whitener is a technical writer, writing instructor, and frequent club-joiner. Nothing brings her greater joy than bringing together people who are working on similar projects but don't know that yet. Some of her other interests include crafting, cats, karaoke, and the hiring process on both sides of the application.
