Sharon spent the first half of her career as an educator and nonprofit professional.  She has a proven track record in thoughtfully growing organizations in diversity, constituents, financially and reputation at large. She has increased the number of donors and giving levels at multiple organizations, allowing organizations to grow their budget and effectiveness. She has brought several nonprofits to the next level utilizing marketing, education, communication, management, development and relationship building skills. When she isn't shmoozing with colleagues turned friends, she can be found drinking ice coffee, no matter the season or country, with her kiddos and techie husband.
