A trained actor with a curious background: from Theatre Studies, to Q/A, to Business Intelligence development, to full stack web development, James is the resident specialist PHP Developer Advocate at Global Cloud Communications giant Vonage. He founded Birmingham, UK's current PHP usergroup BrumPHP, as well as being on the Fusion Meetup team. He mentors, writes and speaks on PHP, Javascript, DevOps, DevRel and tech culture. He pretended to be a DJ on the way.
