Having worked in data for longer than she cares to recall, Lorraine currently works as a community manager, helping others get the best from their data technologies. Working with technology start ups for the past five years has led her to try to wrangle time and work towards maintaining a good work-life balance. A passionate lifelong learner, she indulges her love of art by taking courses, enjoying creating collage works as her alter ego Atomic Mutton.
