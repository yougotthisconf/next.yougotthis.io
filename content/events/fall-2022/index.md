    title="Not Knowing Is Part Of Learning"
    :speakers="['ramon-huidobro']"
    start="2022-09-15T17:10:00Z"
    description="We oftentimes find ourselves confronted with new, situations in our careers that at a first glance are daunting, impossible even. How are we supposed to ever learn something if we don't even know where to start? Is learning even a part of the job? In this session, let's examine how vital a step of learning it is not to know, and how our tech careers are a continuous learning process.">

    title="WTF are OKRs"
    :speakers="['michael-heap']"
    start="2022-09-15T17:25:00Z"
    description="Setting Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) is a common and important part of leading your team - making sure everyone knows what you're working towards. But they can be tricky to get right, and even harder to help others understand. If you're a leader that's ever searched for 'What do OKRs look like?', this talk's for you! We'll start with what OKRs are, how they're measured, and how they should cascade through a business to make sure everyone is on the same page. We'll also cover how to use OKRs to work on what you actually want, not just what others want you to do.">

    title="How To Effectively Take Notes as a Team"
    :speakers="['cassidy-williams']"
    start="2022-09-15T17:45:00Z"
    description="As your teams grow, so does your collective knowledge of all that you've built together. Managing and documenting that knowledge can be daunting, but it's so important for remembering decisions, creating new ideas without reinventing the wheel, and bringing new teammates up to speed. In this talk, we'll discuss strategies for taking (and finding!) notes as a team.">

    :speakers="['carol-huang']"
    start="2022-09-15T18:00:00Z"
    description="Your time is literally all you have in this world. You can’t guarantee health, you can’t guarantee happiness, you can’t even guarantee existing — but while you do have life on this earth, time is what you have. Let’s talk about some tools for identifying what you can (and can’t!) change about your day, and take a little bit of time to reexamine your relationship with time.">

    start="2022-09-15T18:20:00Z"
    description="Interviews are a two-way process, but it's more than just company fit. Your manager is your biggest advocate, but fill your great opportunity with endless challenges. In this talk, we'll cover why and how to interview your next manager as part of your job-hunting process to make sure you end up in a healthy and productive environment.">

    title="Balancing Side Projects and ADHD"
    :speakers="['luke-murphy']"
    start="2022-09-15T18:35:00Z"
    description="ADHD, ADD and similar neuro-behavioural disorders are often seen as the kryptonite of folks completing things. The stereotype for years was the naughty kid at school who could never concentrate, would never finish anything and constantly disrupts everyone else. There’s a balance though, because while some ADHD traits make getting anything done almost impossible, others can be harnessed as superpowers to get shit done. Luke is going to share their experiences of attempting to identify, manage and manipulate these traits, and how this has manifested in successful (and many unsuccessful) side projects through the years. This talk is for folks who have ADHD, suspect they might have ADHD, or are just interested in how different people think and achieve the things they do.">
