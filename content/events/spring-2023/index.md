  :speakers='[people["sharon-weiss-greenberg"]]'
  description="If you want to move up the ladder, finish that project, land that job, secure funding or accomplish just about anything, you need relationships. The ability to network and meaningfully continue relationships is the difference between growing and thinking and doing more and bigger, and having a larger impact or not. In this talk, weâ€™ll cover how to take your relationships and meaningfully and authentically maintain them.">

  title="Understanding Your Remote Working Style"
  start="2023-03-15T18:45:00.000+00:00" 
  :speakers='[people["sylwia-vargas"]]'
  description="Remote work gives us a whole lot of opportunity to rediscover what we (dis)like about our life. We are socialized to believe certain things to be true even if they do not necessarily hold up under scrutiny. More than providing you with tips on specific things that will for sure make you happy, my intention is to share with you an approach I took when trying to figure it out myself - which involved asking questions, observation, and being very confused initially. I've arrived at a place of great joy and stability - and this is something I wish for you too.">

  title="Walking Across The Ethical Minefield"
  start="2023-03-15T19:15:00.000+00:00" 
  :speakers='[people["kestral-gaian"]]'
  description="Whether you write code, manage projects, or run teams, at some point you'll face an impossible question: is what I'm doing ethical? Recent history is littered with examples of times we didn't get it right, from handryers only tested on light skin tones through to Twitter's recent... well, you know. But how do we stop things from exploding when we can't see the mines buiried in the ground? In this talk we'll discuss foresight, hindsight, and how to create ethical checks and balances to help your next project succeed.">
