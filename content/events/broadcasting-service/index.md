### About the talks

- As an online event, all talks will be delivered remotely and live.
- Talks will be 20-25 minutes, with 5-10 minutes of curated questions from the audience (30 minutes total).
- It is generally expected that speakers will share their screen with a slide deck.
- We are only offering talks at this event and not workshops. Our audience will get to watch your talk, but you will not be able to see them.

You Got This! runs event exclusively around core skills such as self-advocacy, working with others, communication skills, self-care, ethics in tech, or anything else needed for a happy, healthy work-life. We do not accept talks about software development languages or tools.

You Got This has a global audience at the full range of career steps (aspiring/junior through to senior managers).

### Submitting a talk

You can submit one or more talk ideas before the end of August 31 2022. You can submit in written, audio, or video form - whatever works for you.

We welcome first-time and experienced speakers alike and can offer mentorship to make your talk as impactful as possible.

We generally have one speaker per talk. If you want to submit a talk with multiple speakers, please [get in touch first](mailto:kevin@yougotthis.io).
