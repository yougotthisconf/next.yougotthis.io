If you find yourself in a job that doesn’t quite feel right, we have your back. A series of talks from across various events will help you to assess the situation, work out your next steps, and either find a resolution or exit gracefully.

First check out this talk from [Keziyah](/people/keziyah-lewis), who reminds us all that it’s good to be a little cynical, to put yourself first, and that it’s really not your job to love your job unconditionally.

If and when you find yourself in a tough situation at work, either with a colleague, a team, or the employer as a whole, it can be tough to figure out what a successful resolution might look like. From having the confidence to ask questions to thinking through conflict in a productive and meaningful way, this talk from [Claire](/people/claire-knight) will help you to frame difficult workplace situations in a productive way.

Sometimes you try your best but things just aren’t working out. The closer to the edge you get, the more questions you might be asking yourself and the more confusing things may week That’s totally natural! But having realized that something’s got to give, how and when is the best time to walk away? [Amy](/people/amy-dickens) is here to help.
